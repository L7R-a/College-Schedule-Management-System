# College Schedule Management System

 This is a college scheduling system that enables the creation, enrollment, and printing of schedules for students, teaching assistants (TAs), and professors.

 To test it, download the two files and run the Schedules file, where it will require you to enter a file with the schedules. Place the absolute path of the lec(2).txt file and then you can start scheduling.
